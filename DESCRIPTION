Description: This package was designed to address two issues, 78 and 69, for the ROpenSci unconf17 concerning avoiding redundant / overlapping packages and a framework for reproducible tables. As this is a complex topic, the smaller tasks being accomplished is producing a list of metrics that can be used to compare similar packages utilizing information collected from CRAN, GitHub, and StackOverflow.
